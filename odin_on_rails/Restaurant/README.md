# Restaurant

# Functionality
A simple restaurant app that utilizes webpack to practice DOM manipulation.

# Process
I am using modules to separate each tab of the restaurant app. I started a simple home tab with animations on each of the tabs. I chose a color scheme to fit the theme of hot coals. The biggest issue I encountered was adding the Google Maps API. My problem was with the initMap function not initializing before the Maps API. I hoisted it in the head and that solved the issue for me.
